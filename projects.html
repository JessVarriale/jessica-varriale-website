       <p>First of all, this entire website is a project!&nbsp;Although they aren't actual coding languages, I learned HTML and some 
        CSS to create an entirely customizable website from scratch.&nbsp;No website templates were used. Even the logo was drawn by hand!</p>

        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 0;">Workflow Automation with n8n (Jun 2025 - Aug 2025)</h2>
        <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">Skills: AI, JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, APIs</h4>
        <p>I had an internship this summer working at a small startup, <a class="link" href="https://www.varritech.com/">
        Varritech Development Services</a>, which focuses on using AI-powered development to develop apps and websites.&nbsp;I had the opportunity
        to work on 9 automation workflows on the n8n platform, integrating third-party APIs, custom webhooks, and JavaScript for dynamic JSON data handling.
        &nbsp;I collaborated with a team of 2 developers while independently leading the majority of projects, ensuring timely delivery and maintainable code.
        &nbsp;Some highlights for my projects include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Statement of Work (SOW) Automator: Developed a workflow that generated full project documents with AI-driven stack recommendations.
            &nbsp;Implemented data parsing and NLPs to streamline planning, becoming the company's primary SOW tool.</li>
          <li>Employee Performance Dashboard: Developed an internal monitoring system that aggregated data from Slack, GitHub, and ClickUp via 
            API integrations.&nbsp;Designed custom KPIs (e.g., response latency, commit frequency, logged hours, video review time) and automated 
            reporting dashboards to provide actionable insights for management.</li>
          <li>Order and Inventory Manager: Built an automation for a real company client, which linked Telegram messages to an Airtable database in real time.
            &nbsp;It enabled instant inventory/order updates using custom webhooks and REST API calls.&nbsp;Incorporated JSON parsing & error-handling to ensure 
            reliability.</li>
          <li>AI Task Generator for ClickUp: Engineered an automation pipeline that required minimal project input and generated detailed, 
            customized task lists in ClickUp using AI models, acting as a virtual project manager.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Below are some brief snippets of my workflows.</p>

      <p class="caption">This workflow snippet is the beginning of the virtual project manager workflow, which generated detailed, 
        customized task lists in ClickUp, as well as supplementary comments, using AI models with minimal input.&nbsp;It starts by analyzing this 
        input, which is the project's Statement of Work, using OpenAI.&nbsp;Then, it makes several HTTP requests to the ClickUp API (both GET and 
        POST requests) to create folders.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">Skills: C, FPGA</h4>
        <p>This project involved a lot of creativity and design, as it involved designing and programming an original game in C for the 
          DE1-SoC FPGA board.&nbsp;Some key features include:</p>
          
        <ul>
          <li>A variety of board features to enrich the game, including VGA output, PS/2 keyboard input, pushbuttons, switches, LEDs, and 
            seven-segment displays</li>
          <li>Advanced coding structure, leveraging both leveraging both interrupts and polling for responsive real-time control of multiple I/O devices</li>
          <li>Game mechanics incorporating difficulty selection, pausing, high score tracking, and strike systems, using FSM logic for state transitions 
            (start menu, gameplay, game over, restart)</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Below are some photos:</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">Skills: Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Design, Altium, LTSpice, Soldering, Circuit Testing, Lab Instrumentation</h4>
        <p>This group project required us to develop a radio receiver by applying electrical theory to create a custom receiver design, while abiding 
          by design constraints.&nbsp;My responsibilities included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Designing the bandpass filter component, opting for a passive second-order Butterworth filter configuration to maximize signal integrity 
            of the radio message, successfully producing frequency cutoffs at approximately 8 and 16 MHz.
          </li>
          <li>Simulating my circuit design using the LTSpice simulation software, and testing using breadboarding and lab instrumentation like spectrum 
            analyzers and oscilloscopes.</li>
          <li>Designing the PCB using Altium, creating schematics and layouts, and assisting in board assembly through a combination of soldering oven 
            and hand-soldering methods.</li>
          <li>Serving as Project Manager, using Gantt charts to keep the team on track for completing various deliverables and engineering reports.</li>
