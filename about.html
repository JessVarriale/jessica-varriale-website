            <p>So, who am I? Great question!</p>
            <p>"My name is Jessica, and I am a third-year Electrical Engineering student at the University of Toronto. I'm passionate about many 
              areas of ECE, with particular interest in digital electronics, including digital systems, low-level hardware, and ASIC design.&nbsp;
              I also enjoy working on circuit and PCB design."
              <br>
              Why am I in engineering in the first place?&nbsp;I was always drawn to it from a young age.&nbsp;I loved fashioning trinkets out of 
              various household items like cardboard and tape, which I dubbed my &quot;inventions&quot;.&nbsp;
              Somehow, none of these ideas made it to step 8 of the inventors' checklist.                
            <br> <br>

            <p class="caption">&quot;Matthew's Monster Potion&quot; belonged to my brother Matthew. I hope that everything else (fleeboflabs 
                and garglebunkers alike) makes perfect sense.
            </p>
            
            <p>I'm sure you want a visualization of who was behind these genius creations.&nbsp;Ask and you shall receive.</p>

                <img alt="Me now" src="menow.jpeg" style="width: auto; height: 40vh;">
            </div>

            <p class="caption">I hope that I look a little more approachable now.</p>
        
            <p>As soon as I learned that &quot;inventors&quot; were actually engineers, I knew I needed to do that for my career.&nbsp;I'm a creative
                person, who moves between various crafts like sewing, knitting, and jewelry creation in my spare time.&nbsp;However, I believe
                that engineering is equally creative.&nbsp;In particular, electrical engineering is so multifaceted due to its ubiquity in our
                modern-day society.&nbsp;I'm very happy with my engineering journey so far; it's been challenging, but so interesting!&nbsp;Check out my 
                &quot;Projects&quot; page and see what I've done.
